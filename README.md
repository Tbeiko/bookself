Welcome to Bookself,

This application runs on Ruby 2.1.5 and Rails 4.2.1.

It is a web application where `users` can list books they've read and want to read along with following other users.
Regular users of the application will sign in through `omniauth facebook`. 

Some users are generated by the administrators though `omniauth identity`. 
These are "famous bookshelves", such as Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, etc. These are saved as `identities` before being saved as `users`.

Users can search for a `book` through our integration with Amazon's API (via the `amazon-ecs gem`).
Relationships between users and books are stored in `user_book`. 

If no other user has added the same book in the past, a `book` will be created from the information gotten from Amazon.
A `user_book` item will be created between that `user` and `book`.

If the book has already been added in the past by another user, only a `user_book` association will be created.

This allows us to keep track of the number of books each user has in common with another.

A `user` can `follow` and `unfollow` another user. This will add it to the user's `following`, and the user's `followers` are all the users following a certain user.

Twitter bootstrap is used for styling, but most of the design is still incomplete.
